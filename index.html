               <h2 class="section-title">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
               <p>
                  Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms "learn" from vast amounts of data, adapt their behavior, and improve their performance over time. This transformative capability is at the heart of modern AI advancements.
