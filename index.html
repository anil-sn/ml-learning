               <p>
                  Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS) are interconnected but distinct fields, with ML being a subset of AI and DS drawing from both. The core difference lies in their scope and primary objective: <strong>AI</strong> is the overarching goal of creating intelligent machines, <strong>ML</strong> is a specific technique for achieving that goal through learning from data, and <strong>DS</strong> is the broader practice of extracting insights and knowledge from data.

                        <h3>Random Forest (Bagging)</h3>
                        <p><strong>The Democratic Committee</strong></p>
                        <p>Multiple models vote on the final decision. Reduces overfitting and increases accuracy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Reducing overfitting, parallel training, feature importance, stable predictions</p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="concept-card">
                        <h3>AdaBoost & Gradient Boosting</h3>
                        <p><strong>The Sequential Learners</strong></p>
                        <p>Models built one after another, each correcting previous mistakes. Powerful but can overfit.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Maximum accuracy, correcting weak learners, competition performance</p>

                        <p>Uses a meta-model to intelligently combine predictions from different base models.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Combining diverse models, leveraging different strengths, advanced ensembling</p>
