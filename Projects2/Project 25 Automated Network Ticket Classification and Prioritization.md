### **Project 25: Automated Network Ticket Classification and Prioritization**

**Objective:** To build an NLP-powered system that automatically classifies and prioritizes network trouble tickets based on their text description, reducing manual triage effort and improving response times.

**Dataset Source:** **Synthetically Generated**. Real network tickets are confidential. We will generate a realistic dataset of tickets by combining templates with keywords specific to different network problems and priorities.

**Model:** We will use a combination of **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert ticket text into numerical features, and two separate **Logistic Regression** classifiers: one to predict the 'Category' and another to predict the 'Priority'.

**Instructions:**
This notebook is fully self-contained and does not require any external files or APIs. Simply run the entire code block in Google Colab.

**Implementation in Google Colab:**
```python

print("The NLP models successfully learned to classify and prioritize network tickets with high accuracy.")
print("Key Takeaways:")
print("- The system can reliably automate the first, crucial step of incident management. A new ticket can be instantly routed to the correct team (e.g., 'Hardware Failure' tickets to the data center team) with the right urgency.")
print("- The interpretability analysis is key to building trust in the system. We can see *why* the model made its decisions; for example, it learned that words like 'outage', 'down', and 'unavailable' are strong indicators of a P1 priority ticket.")
print("- This automation frees up skilled NOC engineers from manual, repetitive triage tasks, allowing them to focus on actually solving the problem. This directly leads to a faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and a more efficient operations team.")
