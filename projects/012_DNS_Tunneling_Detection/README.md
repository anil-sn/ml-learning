# Project 12: DNS Tunneling Detection

## Objective

Build an interpretable machine learning model that can distinguish between legitimate DNS queries and those used for DNS tunneling, based on statistical features like query length, entropy, and subdomain count.

## Business Value

**For Network Security Teams:**
- **Stealthy Attack Detection**: Identify DNS tunneling used to exfiltrate data or establish command & control channels
- **Interpretable Results**: Understand exactly why a DNS query was flagged as malicious for investigative purposes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Deploy lightweight model for high-speed DNS traffic analysis
- **Threat Intelligence**: Build patterns and signatures from detected tunneling attempts

**For Compliance and Risk Management:**
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Prevent covert data exfiltration through DNS channels
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet requirements for advanced threat detection and monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Provide forensic evidence and investigation starting points
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce security incidents through proactive detection

## Core Libraries

- **pandas & numpy**: DNS query data processing and statistical analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Logistic Regression for interpretable classification with balanced class weights
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: DNS query pattern visualization and feature distribution analysis
- **kaggle**: Access to specialized DNS tunneling dataset with pre-calculated features

## Dataset

**Source**: DNS Tunneling Dataset from Kaggle
- **Legitimate DNS**: Normal DNS queries from enterprise network traffic
- **Tunneling DNS**: DNS queries used for data exfiltration and C2 communication
- **Features**: Pre-calculated statistical properties including entropy, length, and subdomain metrics
- **Labels**: Binary classification between 'tunnel' and 'nontunnel' queries

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- **Query Length**: Tunneling queries are longer to encode data
- **Entropy**: High randomness in subdomains to encode binary data
- **Subdomain Count**: Multiple levels of subdomains for data chunking
- **Character Distribution**: Statistical patterns in DNS name construction

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Environment Setup and Data Acquisition
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kaggle
```

Configure Kaggle API and download the DNS tunneling dataset containing labeled DNS queries with statistical features.

### 2. Feature Selection and Analysis
```python
# Focus on most interpretable features for DNS tunneling
feature_cols = ['query_length', 'subdomain_count', 'entropy']
target_col = 'label'

# Encode labels: 'nontunnel' -> 0, 'tunnel' -> 1
df[target_col] = df[target_col].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'tunnel' else 0)
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
```python
# Visualize feature differences between normal and tunneling queries
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 5))
for i, col in enumerate(feature_cols):
    plt.subplot(1, 3, i + 1)
    sns.boxplot(x=target_col, y=col, data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} by Class')
```

### 4. Data Preprocessing and Scaling
```python
# Scale features for optimal Logistic Regression performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### 5. Interpretable Model Training
```python
# Logistic Regression for maximum interpretability
model = LogisticRegression(
    random_state=42, 
    class_weight='balanced'  # Handle any class imbalance
)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

### 6. Model Evaluation and Performance Analysis
```python
# Comprehensive evaluation focusing on both accuracy and interpretability
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Nontunnel', 'Tunnel']))
```

### 7. Feature Importance and Model Interpretability
```python
# Extract and visualize model coefficients
coefficients = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': feature_cols,
    'Coefficient': model.coef_[0]
}).sort_values('Coefficient', ascending=False)

# Positive coefficients indicate features that increase tunneling probability
```

## Success Criteria
