# Project 16: Network Honeypot Log Analysis to Classify Attacker Behavior

## Objective

Automatically discover and classify different types of attacker behavior (e.g., port scanning, login brute-forcing, web scanning) by applying unsupervised clustering to honeypot logs, providing actionable intelligence for security operations teams.

## Business Value

**For Security Operations Teams:**
- **Threat Intelligence**: Automatically categorize attacker behaviors without prior knowledge of attack signatures
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify emerging attack patterns and group similar campaigns together
- **Strategic Defense**: Make data-driven decisions about security controls based on observed attacker clusters
- **Alert Reduction**: Focus on behavioral patterns rather than individual alerts to reduce noise

**For Enterprise Security:**
- **Proactive Defense**: Understand attacker methodologies before they impact production systems
- **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize security investments based on most common attack patterns
- **Incident Response**: Faster triage through automatic behavioral classification
- **Threat Hunting**: Identify novel attack patterns that bypass signature-based detection

## Core Libraries

- **pandas & numpy**: Data processing and aggregation of honeypot log entries
- **scikit-learn**: K-Means clustering for unsupervised behavioral pattern discovery
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Cluster visualization and elbow method analysis
- **sklearn.decomposition**: PCA for dimensional reduction and cluster visualization
- **sklearn.preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature normalization in clustering

## Dataset

**Source**: Synthetically Generated Honeypot Logs
- **Attack Types**: Port scanning, SSH brute-force, web application scanning
- **Log Entries**: Realistic honeypot connection attempts with source IPs, ports, protocols, and messages
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Distinct patterns per attack type (many ports vs single port, different error messages)
- **Scale**: Multiple source IPs with varying numbers of connection attempts per attacker

**Key Behavioral Features:**
- Connection volume per source IP
- Port diversity (unique ports targeted)
- Protocol-specific failure patterns (SSH auth failures, HTTP 404s)
- Target port preferences and common attack patterns

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Environment Setup and Data Generation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Generate synthetic honeypot logs with realistic attack patterns for behavioral analysis.

### 2. Synthetic Honeypot Log Generation
```python
# Define different attacker behavior patterns
behaviors = ['port_scan', 'brute_force_ssh', 'web_scan']

# Port scanners: many connections to different ports
if behavior == 'port_scan':
    for _ in range(random.randint(80, 200)):
        port = random.randint(1, 65535)
        log_entries.append([ip, port, 'TCP', 'Connection refused'])

# SSH brute-forcers: many connections to port 22
elif behavior == 'brute_force_ssh':
    for _ in range(random.randint(50, 150)):
        log_entries.append([ip, 22, 'SSH', 'Authentication failed'])
```

### 3. Feature Engineering for Behavioral Profiling
```python
# Aggregate raw logs by source IP to create behavioral profiles
attacker_profiles = df.groupby('source_ip').agg(
    total_connections=('dest_port', 'count'),
    unique_ports_targeted=('dest_port', 'nunique'),
    ssh_auth_failures=('message', lambda x: x.str.contains('Authentication failed').sum()),
    http_404_errors=('message', lambda x: x.str.contains('404').sum()),
    common_port=('dest_port', lambda x: x.mode()[0])
)
```

### 4. Optimal Cluster Number Selection
```python
# Use elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters
inertia = []
k_range = range(1, 10)
for k in k_range:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    kmeans.fit(X_scaled)
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)
```

### 5. K-Means Clustering for Behavioral Grouping
```python
# Train K-Means with optimal number of clusters
optimal_k = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
attacker_profiles['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
```

### 6. Cluster Analysis and Validation
```python
# Analyze cluster centroids to understand behavioral patterns
cluster_analysis = attacker_profiles.groupby('cluster').mean(numeric_only=True)

# Cross-tabulate with ground truth for validation
pd.crosstab(attacker_profiles['cluster'], attacker_profiles['true_behavior'])
```

## Success Criteria

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Cluster Separation**: Clear distinction between behavioral patterns in cluster centroids
- **Ground Truth Alignment**: >80% agreement between clusters and known attack types
- **Elbow Method Validation**: Clear optimal k selection matching expected number of behaviors

**Secondary Metrics:**
