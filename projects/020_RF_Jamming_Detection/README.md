## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. RF Data Simulation and Collection
```python
# Generate realistic RF measurement data
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def generate_rf_measurements(scenario='normal'):
    # Simulate RSSI values, noise levels, and network performance
    if scenario == 'jamming':
        # High noise floor, degraded SNR
        noise_floor = np.random.normal(-70, 10, 1000)  # Higher noise
        signal_strength = np.random.normal(-60, 5, 1000)
    else:
        # Normal operation
        noise_floor = np.random.normal(-90, 5, 1000)   # Lower noise
        signal_strength = np.random.normal(-50, 3, 1000)
    
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'rssi': signal_strength,
        'noise_floor': noise_floor,
        'snr': signal_strength - noise_floor
    })
```

### 2. Feature Engineering for Jamming Detection
```python
# Extract jamming-indicative features
def extract_jamming_features(df):
    features = {}
    
    # Statistical features
    features['rssi_mean'] = df['rssi'].mean()
    features['rssi_std'] = df['rssi'].std()
    features['noise_floor_mean'] = df['noise_floor'].mean()
    features['snr_mean'] = df['snr'].mean()
    features['snr_min'] = df['snr'].min()
    
    # Temporal features (sudden changes indicate jamming)
    features['rssi_volatility'] = df['rssi'].rolling(10).std().mean()
    features['noise_increase_rate'] = df['noise_floor'].diff().mean()
    
    # Frequency domain features
    fft = np.fft.fft(df['rssi'].values)
    features['spectral_entropy'] = calculate_spectral_entropy(fft)
    
    return features
```

### 3. Machine Learning Model Training
```python
# Train jamming detection classifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Prepare training data with normal and jamming scenarios
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    feature_matrix, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Train Random Forest for robustness
jamming_detector = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    random_state=42,
    class_weight='balanced'
)

jamming_detector.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4. Real-time Jamming Detection
```python
# Real-time detection pipeline
def detect_jamming_realtime(rf_buffer):
    # Extract features from sliding window
    features = extract_jamming_features(rf_buffer)
    
    # Predict jamming probability
    jamming_prob = jamming_detector.predict_proba([list(features.values())])[0, 1]
    
    # Alert if high probability
    if jamming_prob > 0.8:
        return {
            'status': 'JAMMING_DETECTED',
            'confidence': jamming_prob,
            'features': features
        }
    else:
        return {'status': 'NORMAL', 'confidence': jamming_prob}
