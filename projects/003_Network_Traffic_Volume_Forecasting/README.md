# Project 3: Network Traffic Volume Forecasting

## Objective

To predict future network traffic volume based on historical data using time-series analysis and forecasting. This project demonstrates how to build robust time-series models that can accurately forecast future bandwidth demand, enabling proactive network management and capacity planning.

## Business Value

Accurate traffic volume forecasting provides critical advantages for network operations:

- **Capacity Planning**: Justifies and guides network upgrades by predicting when and where future capacity will be needed
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocate resources in virtualized network environments based on predicted demand
- **Congestion Prevention**: Proactively identify future peak usage periods to prevent service degradation and ensure high quality of experience
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize infrastructure investments by accurately predicting future bandwidth requirements
- **SLA Management**: Ensure service level agreements are met by anticipating demand spikes

## Core Libraries

- **pandas**: For robust time-series data manipulation and preprocessing
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For comprehensive data visualization and forecast result analysis
- **prophet**: Facebook's powerful and user-friendly forecasting library designed for time-series with strong seasonal patterns
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation metrics and performance assessment
- **numpy**: For numerical computations and array operations

## Dataset

**Primary Dataset**: Internet Traffic Time Series Dataset from Kaggle (user: shenba)
- **Description**: Daily traffic data from an ISP with clear temporal structure
- **Key Features**: 
  - Historical network traffic measurements
  - Clear seasonality patterns (daily, weekly, yearly)
  - Real-world noise and anomalies
  - Suitable for demonstrating multiple forecasting horizons

**Alternative Dataset**: Hourly Energy Consumption ([Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption))
- **Why it's suitable**: Energy consumption patterns mirror network traffic with similar seasonal behaviors
- **Advantages**: Strong multi-level seasonality, long-term trends, realistic noise patterns

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create project environment
mkdir network-traffic-forecasting
cd network-traffic-forecasting
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required libraries
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn prophet scikit-learn numpy jupyterlab kaggle

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### Step 2: Data Acquisition and Loading
- Set up Kaggle API credentials
- Download Internet Traffic Time Series dataset
- Load and inspect data structure
- Handle missing values and data quality issues

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize historical traffic patterns
- Identify seasonality components (daily, weekly, yearly)
- Analyze trend patterns and outliers
- Understand data distribution and statistical properties

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing
- Convert datetime columns to proper format
- Set datetime as index for time-series operations
- Prepare data in Prophet's required format (ds, y columns)
- Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation

### Step 5: Model Training
- Initialize Prophet model with appropriate seasonality settings
- Configure yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality parameters
- Fit the model to historical training data
- Validate model convergence and parameter estimation

### Step 6: Forecasting and Prediction
- Create future dataframe for prediction horizon
- Generate forecasts with uncertainty intervals
- Extract prediction components (trend, seasonalities)
- Analyze forecast confidence intervals

### Step 7: Model Evaluation
- Compare predictions against held-out test data
- Calculate performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Assess forecast accuracy across different time horizons
- Validate seasonal pattern detection

### Step 8: Results Visualization
- Plot historical data with forecast overlay
- Visualize forecast components (trend, seasonalities)
- Display uncertainty intervals and prediction confidence
- Create comprehensive forecast interpretation

## Technical Implementation

The project uses Facebook's Prophet library, which automatically handles:
- **Seasonality Detection**: Identifies daily, weekly, and yearly patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Captures long-term growth or decline patterns
- **Holiday Effects**: Accounts for irregular events affecting traffic
- **Missing Data**: Robust handling of gaps in time-series data
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence intervals for predictions

## Success Criteria

- **Data Processing**: Successfully load, parse, and index time-series data using pandas
- **Model Training**: Prophet model trains without errors and converges properly
- **Forecasting**: Generate accurate forecasts extending 3-12 months into the future
- **Visualization**: Produce interpretable forecast plots showing historical data, predictions, and uncertainty intervals
- **Component Analysis**: Generate and explain forecast components (trend, seasonalities)
- **Evaluation**: Achieve reasonable performance metrics on held-out test data (RMSE < 15% of mean traffic)

## Key Insights and Learnings

1. **Seasonality Patterns**: Network traffic typically shows strong weekly patterns (lower on weekends) and yearly patterns (seasonal variations)
2. **Trend Analysis**: Long-term traffic growth reflects business expansion and technology adoption
3. **Uncertainty Management**: Prophet provides realistic uncertainty intervals that grow with forecast horizon
4. **Component Interpretation**: Understanding trend and seasonal components enables better business decision-making

## Next Steps and Extensions

### Advanced Modeling
- **External Regressors**: Incorporate holiday calendars, promotional events, or economic indicators
- **Model Comparison**: Compare Prophet against SARIMA, exponential smoothing, or deep learning models
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple forecasting approaches for improved accuracy

### Operational Integration
- **Real-time Forecasting**: Implement automated daily/weekly forecast updates
- **Alert Systems**: Create threshold-based alerts for predicted capacity issues
- **Dashboard Development**: Build interactive dashboards for network operations teams

### Advanced Analytics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual traffic patterns that deviate from seasonal norms
- **Scenario Planning**: Model different growth scenarios and their impact on infrastructure needs
- **Multi-variate Forecasting**: Incorporate multiple network segments or services simultaneously

## Business Impact

This forecasting capability enables:
- **Proactive Infrastructure Planning**: Avoid costly emergency upgrades through predictive capacity management
- **Budget Optimization**: More accurate capital expenditure planning based on data-driven forecasts
- **Service Reliability**: Maintain high service quality by preventing congestion before it occurs
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Support business growth planning with reliable traffic projections
