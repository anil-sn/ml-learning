# Project 25: Automated Network Ticket Classification and Prioritization

## Objective

Build an NLP-powered system that automatically classifies and prioritizes network trouble tickets based on their text description, reducing manual triage effort and improving response times.

## Business Value

**For IT Service Desk:**
- **Automated Triage**: Eliminate manual ticket classification and routing delays
- **Response Time Improvement**: Accelerate high-priority issue resolution through intelligent prioritization
- **Resource Optimization**: Assign specialized technicians to appropriate ticket categories
- **SLA Compliance**: Meet service level agreements through predictive priority assignment

**For Network Operations:**
- **Incident Management**: Streamline network incident response workflows
- **Knowledge Management**: Extract insights from historical ticket patterns
- **Capacity Planning**: Predict staffing needs based on ticket volume and complexity
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Reduce resolution times through efficient ticket handling

## Core Libraries

- **pandas & numpy**: Ticket data processing and text analysis
- **scikit-learn**: TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression for multi-class classification
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Ticket pattern analysis and classification performance visualization
- **nltk/spacy**: Advanced text preprocessing and feature extraction

## Dataset

**Source**: Synthetically Generated Network Trouble Tickets
- **Categories**: Connectivity, Performance, Security, Hardware, Configuration issues
- **Priority Levels**: P1 (Critical), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low)
- **Ticket Text**: Realistic problem descriptions with technical terminology
- **Metadata**: Creation time, affected systems, user impact levels

**Ticket Categories:**
- **Connectivity**: Network outages, routing issues, link failures
- **Performance**: Bandwidth problems, latency issues, throughput degradation  
- **Security**: Intrusion alerts, policy violations, access issues
- **Hardware**: Equipment failures, port problems, power issues
- **Configuration**: Settings errors, policy misconfigurations, change issues

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Synthetic Ticket Dataset Generation
```python
# Create realistic network trouble tickets
templates = {
    'Connectivity': {
        'P1': "Total network outage in {location}. All users affected.",
        'P2': "Intermittent connectivity to {system}. Multiple users impacted.",
        'P3': "Single user cannot access {resource}. Local issue suspected.",
        'P4': "Scheduled maintenance required for {equipment}."
    }
}
```

### 2. Text Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
```python
# Clean and prepare ticket text for analysis
def preprocess_ticket_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    text = ' '.join(text.split())
    return text

# Apply preprocessing to all tickets
df['processed_text'] = df['description'].apply(preprocess_ticket_text)
```

### 3. TF-IDF Vectorization
```python
# Convert text to numerical features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=1000,
    stop_words='english',
    ngram_range=(1, 2)  # Include bigrams for better context
)
X_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['processed_text'])
```

### 4. Multi-class Classification Models
```python
# Separate models for category and priority prediction
category_model = LogisticRegression(
    multi_class='ovr',
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42
)

priority_model = LogisticRegression(
    multi_class='ovr', 
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42
)
```

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
```python
# Train both classification models
category_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train_category)
priority_model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train_priority)

# Evaluate performance
category_pred = category_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
priority_pred = priority_model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
```

### 6. Feature Importance Analysis
```python
# Identify most important terms for each category
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
for category, coef in zip(categories, category_model.coef_):
    top_features = feature_names[coef.argsort()[-10:]]
    print(f"{category}: {top_features}")
```

## Success Criteria
