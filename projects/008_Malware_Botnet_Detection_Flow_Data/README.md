# Project 8: Malware/Botnet Detection from Flow Data

## Objective

To detect malware and botnet communications by analyzing network flow patterns using machine learning. This project focuses on identifying malicious traffic signatures in NetFlow/sFlow data without deep packet inspection, enabling scalable threat detection across large networks.

## Business Value

- **Threat Detection**: Identify malware communications and botnet activities in real-time
- **Network Security**: Protect against data exfiltration and command-and-control traffic
- **Scalable Analysis**: Analyze network flows without performance-impacting deep packet inspection
- **Incident Response**: Enable rapid identification and containment of infected devices
- **Compliance**: Meet security monitoring requirements for regulated industries

## Core Libraries

- **pandas**: Flow data manipulation and feature engineering
- **scikit-learn**: Classification algorithms and model evaluation
- **numpy**: Numerical analysis of flow statistics
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Threat visualization and pattern analysis
- **kaggle**: Access to malware flow datasets

## Technical Approach

**Model**: Random Forest or XGBoost for robust classification
- **Features**: Flow duration, packet sizes, timing patterns, protocol distributions
- **Target**: Binary classification (Benign vs Malicious) or multi-class (specific malware families)
- **Evaluation**: Focus on high recall to minimize missed threats

## Key Features

- Flow-based feature engineering
- Botnet family classification
- Real-time threat scoring
- Network flow pattern analysis
- Integration with SIEM systems

## Dataset

Malware/Botnet network flow datasets from security research organizations, focusing on C&C communications and data exfiltration patterns.
