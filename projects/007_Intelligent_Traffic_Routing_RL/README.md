# Project 7: Intelligent Traffic Routing (Reinforcement Learning)

## Objective

To develop an intelligent traffic routing system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that dynamically optimizes network path selection based on real-time conditions. This project demonstrates how RL agents can learn optimal routing policies to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and balance network load.

## Business Value

- **Dynamic Optimization**: Adapt routing decisions in real-time based on network conditions
- **Improved Performance**: Minimize latency and maximize throughput through intelligent path selection
- **Load Balancing**: Automatically distribute traffic to prevent congestion hotspots
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize bandwidth utilization and reduce infrastructure costs
- **Automated Decision Making**: Replace manual routing adjustments with data-driven automation

## Core Libraries

- **gym**: OpenAI Gym environment for RL training
- **stable-baselines3**: State-of-the-art RL algorithms (PPO, A2C, DQN)
- **networkx**: Network topology modeling and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing for environment simulation
- **matplotlib**: Visualization of network topology and learning curves

## Technical Approach

**Model**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Environment**: Custom network topology with dynamic traffic loads
- **State Space**: Network conditions (link utilization, latency, packet loss)
- **Action Space**: Routing decisions (next hop selection)
- **Reward Function**: Based on QoS metrics (latency, throughput, packet loss)

## Key Features

- Custom network environment simulation
- Multi-objective optimization (latency, throughput, reliability)
- Dynamic traffic pattern adaptation
- Policy visualization and interpretation
- Performance comparison with traditional routing algorithms
