# Project 6: Network Configuration Anomaly Detection / Compliance Check

## Objective

To automatically identify network device configurations that deviate from standard "golden" templates using unsupervised machine learning techniques. This project enables automated compliance auditing, unauthorized change detection, and security policy enforcement across network infrastructure.

## Business Value

- **Compliance Automation**: Ensure adherence to security standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Security Risk Mitigation**: Detect unauthorized configuration changes that could expose vulnerabilities
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate configuration auditing processes that traditionally require manual review
- **Change Management**: Monitor configuration drift from approved baselines
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce compliance audit costs and accelerate certification processes

## Core Libraries

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and configuration analysis
- **scikit-learn**: TF-IDF vectorization and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Visualization of anomalies and compliance status
- **numpy**: Numerical computing for text analysis

## Dataset

**Synthetic Network Configuration Dataset**: Generated from realistic network device templates
- **Golden Templates**: Standard approved configurations for different device types
- **Anomalous Configurations**: Configurations with introduced deviations (IP changes, missing security rules, policy violations)

## Implementation Approach

**Model**: Combines TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with Isolation Forest
- **TF-IDF**: Converts network configurations into numerical vectors for analysis
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised anomaly detection to identify outlier configurations

## Key Features

- Synthetic data generation for realistic network scenarios
- Text-based configuration analysis
- Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Compliance reporting and visualization
- Scalable to large network infrastructure
