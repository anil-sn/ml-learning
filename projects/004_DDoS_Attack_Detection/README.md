# Project 4: DDoS Attack Detection

## Objective

To build a high-performance machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate (Benign) network traffic and malicious DDoS attack traffic based on network flow features. This project demonstrates how to apply supervised learning techniques to cybersecurity challenges, enabling real-time threat detection and network protection.
