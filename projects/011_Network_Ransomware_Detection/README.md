# Project 11: Network-based Ransomware Detection

## Objective

Build a machine learning model that can identify network traffic patterns associated with ransomware activity, distinguishing them from normal, benign traffic through advanced pattern recognition and anomaly detection techniques.

## Business Value

**For Network Security Teams:**
- **Early Detection**: Identify ransomware attacks in progress before file encryption causes irreversible damage
- **Automated Response**: Enable automated quarantining and incident response workflows
- **Network Forensics**: Understand unique communication patterns of ransomware for threat intelligence
- **Cost Avoidance**: Prevent costly ransomware incidents that average $1.85M per attack (IBM Security)

**For Enterprise IT:**
- **Proactive Defense**: Shift from reactive to proactive ransomware protection
- **Compliance Support**: Meet regulatory requirements for advanced threat detection
- **Business Continuity**: Minimize operational disruption through early warning systems
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce cyber insurance costs through demonstrable security controls

## Core Libraries

- **pandas & numpy**: Data processing and numerical computations
- **scikit-learn**: RandomForestClassifier with balanced class weights for handling imbalanced datasets
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Network traffic pattern visualization and confusion matrix analysis
- **kaggle**: CIC-IDS2017 dataset access containing real WannaCry ransomware traffic samples

## Dataset

**Source**: CIC-IDS2017 from Kaggle - A comprehensive cybersecurity dataset
- **Benign Traffic**: Monday working hours normal network activity
- **Ransomware Traffic**: Friday morning captures including WannaCry attack samples
- **Features**: 80+ network flow characteristics including timing, packet flags, and flow statistics
- **Scale**: Hundreds of thousands of network flows with extreme class imbalance (ransomware is rare)

**Key Features for Detection:**
- Flow Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) patterns
- Packet flag distributions (URG, PSH, RST flags)
- Flow duration and idle time statistics
- Packet size distributions and byte counts

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Environment Setup and Data Acquisition
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kaggle
```

Set up Kaggle API credentials and download the CIC-IDS2017 dataset containing both benign and ransomware network traffic samples.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Class Balance Handling
```python
# Load benign and ransomware traffic files
df_benign = pd.read_csv('Monday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv')
df_ransomware = pd.read_csv('Friday-WorkingHours-Morning.pcap_ISCX.csv')

# Handle extreme class imbalance using downsampling
df_majority_downsampled = df_majority.sample(n=len(df_minority)*5, random_state=42)
```

### 3. Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
```python
# Clean column names and handle infinite values
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
df.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Binary encoding: Ransomware -> 1, Benign -> 0
df['Label'] = df['Label'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Ransomware' else 0)
```

### 4. Model Training with Balanced Classification
```python
# RandomForest with balanced class weights for imbalanced data
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    random_state=42,
    class_weight='balanced',  # Critical for rare event detection
    n_jobs=-1
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 5. Security-Focused Evaluation
```python
# Focus on recall for ransomware detection
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Benign', 'Ransomware']))

# Analyze false negatives (missed attacks) - most critical metric
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"False Negatives (Missed Ransomware): {cm[1,0]}")
```

### 6. Feature Importance for Network Forensics
```python
# Identify most predictive network features
importances = model.feature_importances_
top_features = X.columns[np.argsort(importances)[-15:]]
```

## Success Criteria

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Recall for Ransomware Class**: >95% (minimize missed attacks)
- **Precision Balance**: Maintain reasonable precision to avoid alert fatigue
- **F1-Score**: >0.85 for overall model effectiveness

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **False Negative Rate**: <5% (critical for security applications)
- **Model Interpretability**: Clear feature importance rankings for forensic analysis
- **Processing Speed**: Real-time inference capability for network monitoring

**Business Impact:**
- Deploy model in network monitoring infrastructure
- Integrate with SIEM systems for automated alerting
- Provide forensic insights for incident response teams

## Next Steps & Extensions

### Immediate Improvements
- **Multi-class Classification**: Distinguish between different ransomware families
- **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporate temporal patterns in network flows
- **Feature Selection**: Apply dimensionality reduction for faster inference

### Advanced Techniques

- **Model Monitoring**: Drift detection and automated retraining workflows
- **Alert Integration**: SOAR platform connectivity for automated incident response

### Domain Expansion
- **Cross-Protocol Analysis**: Extend to email, web, and DNS traffic patterns
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate with external threat feeds and IOCs
- **Zero-Day Detection**: Behavioral analysis for unknown ransomware variants
