# Project 9: Root Cause Analysis for Network Outages (NLP & Graph ML)

## Objective

To automatically analyze network outage incidents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Machine Learning to identify root causes, predict failure propagation patterns, and recommend remediation strategies. This project combines textual incident reports with network topology analysis.

## Business Value

- **Faster Resolution**: Accelerate incident resolution through automated root cause identification
- **Knowledge Management**: Learn from historical incidents to prevent similar outages
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues and systemic problems
- **Resource Optimization**: Direct technical resources to highest-impact remediation actions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Build organizational learning from incident data

## Core Libraries

- **spacy**: Advanced NLP for incident report processing
- **transformers**: BERT/RoBERTa for semantic understanding of technical descriptions
- **networkx**: Network topology analysis and graph algorithms
- **scikit-learn**: Text classification and clustering
- **pandas**: Incident data manipulation and analysis

## Technical Approach

**NLP Component**:
- Text preprocessing and entity extraction from incident reports
- Classification of incident types and severity levels
- Semantic similarity analysis for pattern matching

**Graph ML Component**:
- Network topology representation and analysis
- Failure propagation modeling
- Centrality analysis for critical component identification

## Key Features

- Automated incident categorization
- Root cause hypothesis generation
- Failure impact prediction
- Historical pattern matching
- Interactive incident exploration

## Dataset

Network incident reports, trouble tickets, and network topology data combined to create comprehensive outage analysis.
