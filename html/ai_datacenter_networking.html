                    <h2 class="section-title">Core Networking Protocols for AI</h2>
                    <p>Two primary technologies dominate the high-performance networking landscape for AI datacenters: InfiniBand and Ethernet. While InfiniBand has historically been a strong contender, Ethernet, with significant enhancements, is rapidly becoming the predominant choice due to its open standards and broad ecosystem.</p>

                    <h3>InfiniBand</h3>
                    <p>Historically, InfiniBand has been a dominant technology in high-performance computing (HPC) and early AI training networks. It is known for its extremely low latency and an architecture designed to minimize packet loss, which is highly beneficial for AI workloads. InfiniBand also offers features like in-network computing and adaptive routing. However, it is often considered a proprietary and more expensive solution compared to Ethernet. For a deeper dive, refer to resources like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband/" target="_blank">NVIDIA's InfiniBand Solutions page</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Ethernet for AI (RoCE, DCB, Ultra Ethernet)</h3>
                    <p>Ethernet is rapidly gaining traction and is expected to become the predominant networking technology in AI datacenters. As an open and widely adopted standard, Ethernet has evolved to meet the demanding requirements of AI with significant enhancements. For a deep dive into a large AI supercluster's networking, see <a href="https://youtu.be/Jf8EPSBZU7Y?si=ufDalwc55hFmTQlN" target="_blank">Inside the World's Largest AI Supercluster xAI Colossus</a>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet (RoCE):</strong> This protocol allows direct memory access between nodes without involving the CPU, significantly reducing latency and enabling lossless communication. RoCEv2 is specifically optimized for AI/ML clusters. Learn more about <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet/roce/" target="_blank">RoCE from NVIDIA</a> or this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems/7.4?topic=communications-smc-r-roce-overview" target="_blank">IBM overview on RoCE</a>. For an overview of AI data center networks, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/rVW6N-ECyq0?si=vYHc-JRF7Mb6Zw-9" target="_blank">AI Data Center Networks</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Center Bridging (DCB):</strong> This set of enhancements enables high-capacity, low-latency, and lossless data transmission over Ethernet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Congestion Control Mechanisms:</strong> Protocols like Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN) and Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) are implemented to detect and resolve congestion, preventing packet loss and ensuring reliable data flow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ultra Ethernet (UE):</strong> This emerging initiative builds upon the Ethernet standard to specifically address the needs of AI and HPC workloads, aiming for open, interoperable, and high-performance communication. It includes innovations to improve network utilization and reduce "tail latency." Explore the <a href="https://ultraethernet.org/resources/" target="_blank">Ultra Ethernet Consortium resources</a> for whitepapers and specifications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The trend indicates a future where both InfiniBand and enhanced Ethernet will coexist, with Ethernet increasingly dominating due to its continuous improvements, cost-effectiveness, and broad compatibility.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Network Design Principles for AI Datacenters</h2>
                    <p>The architecture of an AI datacenter network is designed to maximize performance, scalability, and resilience. Specific topologies and traffic management strategies are employed to handle the unique demands of AI workloads.</p>

                    <h3>Leaf-Spine (Clos Fabric)</h3>
                    <p>This two-tier architecture is widely recommended for its optimal performance and scalability. It provides non-blocking, any-to-any connectivity between servers, ensuring efficient traffic routing and redundancy across the entire cluster. Leaf-spine fabrics can be designed with multiple layers to support varying scales of GPU clusters.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: var(--spacing-lg);">
                        <img src="../image/leaf_spine_topology_placeholder.png" alt="Leaf-Spine Network Topology" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: var(--border-radius-md); box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);">
                        <em>Figure 2: Leaf-Spine Network Topology (Placeholder)</em>
                    </p>
                    <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder image with an actual Leaf-Spine Network Topology Diagram. -->

                    <h3>Other Topologies (Fat-Tree, Dragonfly)</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Clos networks, Fat-Tree topologies are also used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, offering balanced bandwidth and scalability by increasing link capacity higher up the hierarchy to prevent bottlenecks. Dragonfly topologies are particularly effective for very large-scale GPU clusters, as they minimize the number of hops between nodes, which is beneficial for workloads requiring extensive all-to-all communication.</p>

                    <h3>Traffic Patterns: East-West vs. North-South</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>East-West Traffic:</strong> This refers to the high-volume communication between GPUs and nodes within the cluster, essential for multi-node AI training and collective operations. It demands extremely high bandwidth and ultra-low latency to prevent bottlenecks and ensure efficient data flow.</li>
                        <li><strong>North-South Traffic:</strong> This involves communication between the AI cluster and external resources, such as remote data storage, management systems, and the internet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>AI datacenter networks are primarily optimized for East-West traffic, as this constitutes the majority of data movement during AI training.</p>

                    <h3>Dedicated Networks</h3>
                    <p>Often, separate networks are deployed for management, storage, and out-of-band (OOB) access to optimize data access, reduce latency, and enhance security. This segmentation helps isolate different types of traffic and ensures critical management functions are not impacted by high-volume data transfers.</p>
